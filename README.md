# fmjs

a boilerplate node project with the stuff I like.

uses node, gulp, express, connect-assets, jade, coffeescript, and stylus.

```
coffee app.coffee [port]
```

or, for production or you havent got coffeescript installed globally:

```
node index.js [port]
```

to build assets
```
gulp
```

to build assets and watch for changes
```
gulp start
```

# TODO:

- autobuild assets in dev mode (without manually running gulp)
